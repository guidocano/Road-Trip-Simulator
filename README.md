About this game.

RTS is a text-based adventure game, currently in development with Python. During the game you can choose your own path, take choices, select which items bring with you. The game then remembers your choices and that affects the outcome of your next run and which ending you might get. It's a game planned with replayability in mind and that's the only way to truly finish it.
